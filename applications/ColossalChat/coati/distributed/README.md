# Distributed RL Framework for Language Model Fine-Tuning

This repository implements a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) training framework designed to fine-tune large language models using algorithms such as **GRPO** and **DAPO**. It supports multi-node and multi-GPU setups, scalable rollout generation, and policy optimization using libraries like VLLM. Currently, we support two Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) tasks: solving math problems and code generation.

**Please note that we are still under intensive development, stay tuned.**

## üöÄ Features

* **Distributed Training with Ray**: Scalable to multiple machines and GPUs.
* **Support for GRPO and DAPO**: Choose your preferred policy optimization algorithm.
* **Model Backends**: Support `vllm` as inference backends.
* **Rollout and Policy Decoupling**: Efficient generation and consumption of data through parallel inferencer-trainer architecture.
* **Evaluation Integration**: Easily plug in task-specific eval datasets.
* **Checkpoints and Logging**: Configurable intervals and directories.

## Architecture Design

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcaitech/public_assets/main/applications/chat/producer-consumer-pattern.png" width=700/>
  </p>
</div>
Producer-Consumer Pattern: a classic software design pattern used for managing resources, data, or tasks between two different processes or threads.

* Producer: inference engine which rollouts out examples and saves them into a shared buffer.
* Consumer: training framework which takes training examples from the shared buffer and train the policy model.

Key features for Producer-Consumer Pattern:
* Buffer: Acts as a shared queue where the producer adds data and the consumer removes data.
* Concurrency: Rollout and training can work concurrently.

## üß† Data Format

Samples in the training or evaluation `.jsonl` file should follow the format specific to the type of task. We currently support two RLVR tasks: solving math problems and code generation.

### Math Data Format
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Simplify $\\sqrt[3]{1+8} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{1+\\sqrt[3]{8}}$."
  },
  "gt_answer": "3"
}
```

### Code Data Format
We support [Prime code dataset format](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME). Inputs and outputs in test cases should be two lists containing only strings and matching in the number of elements. Your prompt must properly instruct the LLM to generate code to read test cases from stdin and output results to stdout.
```json
{
    "messages": {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Solve the following coding problem using the programming language python:\n\nMikhail walks on a Cartesian plane. He starts at the point $(0, 0)$, and in one move he can go to any of eight adjacent points. For example, ..."
    },
    "test_cases": {
        "inputs": [
            "3\n2 2 3\n4 3 7\n10 1 9\n"
        ],
        "outputs": [
            "1\n6\n-1\n"
        ]
    }
}
```

## üîÑ Constraints and Notes

* `num_inferencer + num_trainer == NUM_GPUs`
* `num_inferencer % num_trainer == 0`
* `(num_inferencer * inference_batch_size) % (num_trainer * train_batch_size) == 0`
* `train_batch_size >= train_minibatch_size >= train_microbatch_size`
* `inference_batch_size >= inference_microbatch_size`
* Set microbatch sizes based on **VRAM capacity**
* To use tensor parallelism on inferencer
  * set backend to `vllm`
  * change `tensor_parallel_size` in `inference_model_config` in rl_example.py
  * set `num_inferencer = NUM_INFERENCE_GPUs / tensor_parallel_size`
* To set tensor parallelism / pipeline parallelism / zero stage
  * change corresponding settings in `plugin_config` in rl_example.py
* Ensure rollout generation rate matches trainer consumption:

  ```
  num_inferencer * inference_batch_size % (
    num_trainer * train_batch_size /
    train_pipeline_parallelism_size /
    train_tensor_parallelism_size
  ) == 0
  ```
* Model weights sync every:

  ```
  (num_inferencer * inference_batch_size) /
  (num_trainer * train_batch_size /
    train_pipeline_parallelism_size /
    train_tensor_parallelism_size)
  ```
* Reward Type

    We currently support three reward types--- `think_answer_tags`, `boxed`, `code`, each varies in details such as how answer is extracted and the reward calculation process. Please select one from `think_answer_tags`, `boxed` for math problem solving and use `code` for code generation. The default system prompt for each reward type is as follows. Please make sure your system prompt provides information for the answer to be correctly extracted from model responses.

    * think_answer_tags

        Answer extraction: extract the content between the last `<answer>`, `</answer>` tags.

        ```
        You are a helpful assistant. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think><answer> answer here </answer>. Now the user asks you to solve a math problem that involves reasoning. After thinking, when you finally reach a conclusion, clearly output the final answer without explanation within the <answer> </answer> tags, i.e., <answer> 123 </answer>.\n\n
        ```
    * boxed

        Answer extraction: extract the last content marked by `\\boxed{}`
        ```
        Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.
        ```
    * code

        Answer extraction: extract code inside ` ```python\n...``` `
        ```

## üß™ Example: multi-machine TP+PP Strategy

### Create ray cluster on multi-machine
For example, now we have 4 nodes and their IPs are 10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4, 10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.6.
We use 10.0.0.3 as master node. First we start a ray cluster on 10.0.0.3:
```bash
ray start --head --node-ip-address=10.0.0.3
```

Then, for each slave node (10.0.0.4/10.0.0.5/10.0.0.6), we add to the ray cluster by following code:
```bash
ray start --address='10.0.0.3:6379'
```

Modify plugin_config in ./applications/ColossalChat/rl_example.py
```python
plugin_config={
  "tp_size": 4,
  "pp_size": 2,
  "microbatch_size": max(
    1, args.train_microbatch_size // 2
  ),  # microbatch size should be set to train_microbatch_size // pp_size
  "zero_stage": 1,
  "max_norm": 1.0,
  },  # for pp, tp
```

```bash
# Hint1: replace /models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B to your model path
#        replace /datasets/train-alignment.jsonl to your dataset path
python rl_example.py
  -m /path/to/Qwen2.5-Math-7B/ \
  -d /path/to/train_data.jsonl \
  --master_address '10.0.0.3'
